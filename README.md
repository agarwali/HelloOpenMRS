This is an Hello World example of using maven module archetype
https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Using+the+Module+Maven+Archetype
to create an OpenMRS module, and sharing module on github.

I am trying to build an Hello World Module for OpenMR that will help new developers undertand the modular concept and design of OpenMRS.
Please feel free to fork this repo and contribute to this project.
